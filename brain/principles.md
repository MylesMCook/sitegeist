# Principles

<!-- Managed by pi-brainerd when this file is package-owned. Edit linked
principle files instead of editing this entrypoint directly. -->

Read this file first, then open the linked principle files that matter to the
current task.

- [[principles/boundary-discipline.md]] - Add a boundary only when it removes real complexity from callers.
- [[principles/fix-root-causes.md]] - Repeated cleanup is a signal that the system shape is wrong.
- [[principles/oauth-runtime-boundaries.md]] - Keep provider-specific auth quirks inside the provider adapter. Generic auth code should handle orchestration, persistence, and refresh, not provider wire formats.
- [[principles/outcome-oriented-execution.md]] - Optimize for the actual result the user needs.
- [[principles/prove-it-works.md]] - Prefer tests, concrete verification, and replayable evidence over confidence.
- [[principles/subtract-before-you-add.md]] - Start by removing scope, options, or abstractions that are not earning their keep.
